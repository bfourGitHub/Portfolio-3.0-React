# Portfolio-3.0-React
React Portfolio. UW Coding Boot Camp

This Updated portfolio reflects the skills learned this far in the UW Coding Bootcamp.This portfolio also serves as a refresher course in skills I've developed over the years. I used Photoshop to create the main photo, illustrator to update my resume, and also took advantage of bootstrap and react-bootstrap css framework to style the page.

This portfolio application also serves as one of my first react webpages.Using components and assembling a page with reusable parts seems to be a an excellent skill to have. Several things were a bit challenging at first but gave me the opportunity to practice skills.
